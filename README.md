# OSRS-Music-Search

This program is actually C# not JS

This is a program that searches the OSRS Music Map as given a while ago on r/2007scape
Please do not change the shape of the window itself. The way I have the code set, it would not work properly if the window changes size.
The map is taken from this address:  http://i.imgur.com/opmAfho.jpg

Please let me know on reddit of any suggestions or bugs you find.

I will also try to keep this updated and make it run faster and better.
Thanks for you help and support.
